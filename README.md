# The Effects of Skin Lesion Segmentation on the Dermoscopic Image Classification Performance
This repository contains the utilized classification probability vectors and also the automatically created segmentation masks that are used in our study. The CSV files and the segmentation masks can be found in the results folder.

## Files description:
- image_ids: Contains the image IDs that are only classified correctly with one of the datasets
- predictions.zip: contains predictions for both sets of experiments. The classification prediction vectors for the first set of experiments are inside the "manual segmentation" folder and the classification prediction vectors for the second set of experiments are inside the "automatic segmentation" folder
- Segmentation_masks.zip: contains the automatically created segmentation masks for all 600 test images. These segementation masks were used in the second set of experiments.
